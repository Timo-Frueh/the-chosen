You slowly open your eyes and wake up. You can't remember anything.
No, wait, there is something ...
Suddenly, a clear thought springs into your mind.
Is it a memory? A vision? You speak it out loud:

Greetings, adventurer. Are you aware of the difficulty of the task ahead? I suppose it is not so, for you would not be here if it were. So let me tell about your Quest:
You must find the legendary Swords of Dusk and Dawn in order to kill the Demon King and thus finally end his cruel reign and free the land from the clutches of his demons.
Fare thee well!

Not a memory, then, but a message.

You once again try to think back with all force you can muster ...
And a name pops into your memory. Anyone's name?
No, your name ... Must be ...
