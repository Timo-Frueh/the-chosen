          Long time no see! Have you heard the latest gossip? 
          We all know that the Demon King can be killed with the legendary Swords, right? 
          Rumour has it that that you must first prove your worth to those Swords by
          killing seven of the Demon King's minions. Only then will they obey you. 
          But what do I know!
---
Go on, then. Kill the demons, find the swords and kill the King. You can do it,
          my friend, I'm sure of it.
