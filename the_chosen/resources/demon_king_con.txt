Aah, greetings, Chosen. You are here at last. What took you so long? My demons certainly were no challenge for you, for you are in the possession of the legendary Swords of Dusk and Dawn, is that not so? Even as powerful a servant as Mandrak would not have been able to withstand those dreadful blades of yours, the bringers of death and destruction.
Are you here to kill me, then? Do you want to take my throne? You want to take my world from me, because you think it belongs to you mortals? You want to end my eternal reign and rid the world of my kind?
Come on then, try to ban me from my realm, try to destroy my immortal soul with these weapons you carry, and I'll behead you right where you stand!

What are you waiting for? Come here and fight!
