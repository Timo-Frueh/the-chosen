You grip the swordhilts and draw the blades. An-Harat blocks your first thrust
with ease and starts a vicious counterattack, aiming for your throat. The Sword of
Dusk sweeps up, deflecting An-Harats blade. But he keeps his balance and comes at you
again. He pushes you back with a series of incredibly fast attacks and you have to step
back a few paces, all while blocking his slashes with both your swords.
A shallow cut appears on your arm, seeping blood. Doubt enters your mind. Can you truly
defeat this beast? You feel the swords in your hands becoming warmer and strength floods
back into your tired arms. You push away all thoughts and launch an attack yourself. You lunge
towards your enemy, the Sword of Dawn reaching for An-Harat's chest. He blocks your thrust
but you turn around and fight on, faster and faster, until your eyes can barely see your blades
anymore. You feel your foe tiring, each of his moves becoming slower and less controlled.
Finally you spot an opening in An-Harat's defense and move in for the kill. The Sword of Dawn
sinks into the Demon King's chest, his sword clatters to the ground and you look into his
eyes, their fire slowly fading.
