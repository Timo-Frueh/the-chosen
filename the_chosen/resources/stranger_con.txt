Hm. Another one. The world is going mad .... And what do you do?
                You wave around your sword as if you were able to do something.

                Damn. Why would I possibly be so stupid as to lose both my wand and
                the bottle the high priest gave me? I won't be able to kill those
                terrible demons without them ...
