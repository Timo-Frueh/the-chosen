You are in a damp cellar. It's cold, the walls are all made of grey rock and it's generally rather unpleasant here. The only light is coming from a torch mounted to the north wall. You can also see the decaying body of a long dead ... thing? (it is definitely not human) chained to the east wall. That must be where the unbearable stench is coming from.
