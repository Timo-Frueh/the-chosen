You slowly open your eyes and wake up. You can't remember anything.
No, wait, there is something ... You strain and a name pops into your memory. Anyones name? No, your name ... Must be ...
Suddenly, a clear sentence springs into your mind. Is it a memory? A vision? You speak it out loud:

Hello, adventurer. Are you aware, however, of the difficulty of the task ahead? I suppose it is not so, for you would not be here otherwise.
Let me therefore tell about you Quest: You must find the legendary Swords of Dusk and Dawn in order to kill the Demon King
and thus finally ending his cruel reign and freeing the land from the clutches of his demons.
Fare thee well!

Not a memory, then, but a message.
